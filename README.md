Case for 2host a DIY USBMIDI host-to-host adapter created by okyeron

The files case is broken up into a top and bottom piece that is assembled with 2.5 X 8 mm screws and hex nuts

The top could use some snap attachments on either side where the USB cords are inserted. 
Currently they are modeled flush and simply butt together - could be more elegant for sure.
